# Project-11-Performance-Optimization
Treehouse FEWD Project 11

----
This is my 11th project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Validated HTML, CSS - Errors are within acceptable limits per project criteria. There are 2 parse errors that are part of Foundation.js;
  didn't mess with trying to fix them.
* Tested on a Mac with Safari 9.1.1 (11601.6.17), Chrome 51.0.2704.63, Firefox 46.0.1
* Went only for Meets Criteria this time to direct more time into my portfolio (next project)
* Should be 22-24 HTTP requests, depending on which browser's dev tools you use
* Page weight should fall between 949kb and 1.10MB, again reported slightly differently by each browser
* CSS/JS were minified and images resized as much as I felt comfortable to get within page weight requirements.

**Needs Work, Need to Learn, and Thoughts:**
* I need to go back and spend some serious time with Gulp and automation tasks. Real life constraints prevented me from really exploring
  its usefulness for this project this time around.
* It was really hard for me to know what size to shrink images down to, what "too small/low quality" is. I was probably too conservative
  here and could go further in the future, but was able to preserve quality sufficiently. Retina screens were a slight consideration in my 
  sizing.
* This was more challenging than I thought, partially because it was a project written by someone else to optimize. This is probably
  similar to real developer work so it was a good excerise to try to sort out someone else's project.

~Time to complete: 5 days including watching videos. Work travel prevented me from rewatching Gulp info, so I made a conscious decision
  to finish this project more quickly and allow time for working on my last project, my portfolio.
